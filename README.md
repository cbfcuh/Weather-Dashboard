The task of this weeks challange was to use "5 Day Weather Forecast" API so that the user can have an outlook for multiple cities. When they user enters the desired city into the search-bar, the data is retrieved through the use of API calls and displayed in a formatted structure that is easy to read. With every search that the user inputs the data is then stored locally so that the user can easily re-access the previous cities data. 

# Installation
Prior to starting this challenge you will need to go to this <a href="https://openweathermap.org/forecast5">link</a> and request an API key. With this key you will be able to make requests to the server and retrieve the relevant data.

# Challenges
Some of the challenges I personally face during this challenge was: 
<li>Personally it took me some time to grasp making API calls and storing the data correctly in order to have everything function accordingly</li>
<li>Typo - Initally I was unable to get the API calls to work, after extensive troubleshooting I realised I had add an unnecessary " " into the API key, hence it took me longer than anticipated to complete.</li>

# Improvements
<li>Having the search container and the displayed data structured more fittingly to the webpage, such as spacing between the forcasted data that way they do not appear as clustered.</li>
<li>With the search input, when the user types in a city have the it also generate suggestions, for example: "Melbourne, Victoria". This way the data being displayed is more accurate, it would make a big difference to the user especially if there are multiple cities across the world that share the same name.</li>
